# Object Oriented Computer-Programming
This repository contains projects and assignments/activities from CS 400. Projects are more large scale, and typically will use specific data types to keep track of all the information. These projects are partially student lead and partially directed by specifications, with increasing freedoms as project numbers increase. Activies are smaller scaled and more specific in terms of specifications.

PROJECT NOTES:
The projects in this course were done in small, 4 person teams. Each person would be designated a specific role, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Data Wrangler, or Integration Manager. 

Each project has a README file which summarizes the projects specifics. 

Project 2 is especially notable because I pioneered the idea which lead to the project, and provided assitance to both the frontend and backend developers while completing my role as the data wrangler. 

Project 3 contains a video demonstrating its usage which can be found in the README file specific to that project.
(Project 3 has a demonstration because I was the integration manager for this project, and it was a part of our responsibities. For the other projects I took on different roles, and therefore, do not have demonstration videos for them)


ACTIVITIES NOTES:
Both FX activities involve HTML, and can be seen working in different ways. 
The first activtiy has a screenshot which proves it is working, which can be found in the folder pertaining to the activity.
The second activity working is linked here:

There is a CGI to HTML activity which can also be seen working through a webpage, linked here:

An aptly named "HTML Activity" can be found working under this link:
